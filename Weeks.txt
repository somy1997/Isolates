Week 0 (Winter Vacations) :

Literature Survey - find what different commercial and open source platforms use to provide application level sandboxing

https://medium.com/@zackbloom/isolates-are-the-future-of-cloud-computing-cf7ab91c6142 = blog on isolates
https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/ = provides serverless computing architecture without using vm or containers. cloudflare workers support js only. 194 data centres. We are trying to develop something that is language agnostic.

Read the above blog on isolates.

Week 1 :

COMSNETS 2020 : No one's available.
Reading Paper SAND. Read till page 6.
Created the literature survey table on notebook, everything present in Sand.

Week 2 :

// Study the repo https://github.com/hobochild/sandy used to place custom blocks on read calls. Try to block read calls in a similar way. Understand how they are doing.
Completed reading the paper SAND. SAND mentions in chapter 9 at the end of using LWC (light weight contexts).
See if the methods mentioned in http://books.gigatux.nl/mirror/networksecuritytools/0596007949/networkst-CHP-7-SECT-2.html works? Some nuances :
1. The website asks to look at /usr/include/bits/syscall.h but it is actually present at several locations like :
    /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/vsyscall.h
    /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/sys/syscall.h
    /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/syscall.h
    /usr/include/syscall.h
2. For intercept_open method, had to change the Makefile to the one in Abhijit sir's tutorial on LKM. Didn't work anyways. Showed a lot of errors. Tried with both /usr/src/linux-headers-'uname -r' and /lib/modules/'uname -r'
3. For intercept_unlink method, had to use 'sudo grep sys_call_table /boot/System.map-4.15.0-45-generic' which resulted in
    ffffffff81e001e0 R sys_call_table
    ffffffff81e015a0 R ia32_sys_call_table
After correcting some syntax errors the module was create with some warnings but while inserting it was not returning. Also, it was displaying the message 'Killed', may be because it wasn't allowed.

Week 3 : 

Completed watching Jerome's DockerCon video explaing cgroups, ... : https://youtu.be/sK5i-N34im8
Reattempting LKM tutorial
Testing method to work around 'Killed' message, following : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59812156/how-can-i-override-a-system-call-table-entry-with-my-own-function 
Install vim and cscope : sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vim cscope. Refer http://cscope.sourceforge.net/large_projects.html
The stackoverflow method checks out.
Observation : On grep, the strace method shows only a few system calls but the dmesg command shows a lot of open calls probably because the dmesg command is showing all the open calls including those called by other processes in the system.

Week 4 :

Out of station from Jan 28 to Feb 5

Week 5 :

Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26451729/how-to-get-process-id-name-and-status-using-module . It has mentions of good references for newbies in kernel programming.
asmlinkage = Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10459688/what-is-the-asmlinkage-modifier-meant-for , https://www.quora.com/Linux-Kernel/Linux-Kernel-What-does-asmlinkage-mean-in-the-definition-of-system-calls#
Process ID, name = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26451729/how-to-get-process-id-name-and-status-using-module
User ID = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14097389/how-to-get-userid-when-writing-linux-kernel-module
current in kernel = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12434651/what-is-the-current-in-linux-kernel-source?noredirect=1&lq=1
obj-m = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57839941/what-is-the-meaning-of-obj-m-in-linux-device-driver-makefile
make variables = https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/make-3.79.1/html_chapter/make_6.html

Used the stackoverflow method to log the calls made to open system call by defining the custom open function.
Printing the process name, process ID and user ID for each call.
Next plan to do the same thing with close, read, write syscalls as well using the same LKM.
Created a generic Makefile to take care of creating and deleting the module and insmodding and rmmodding the module. Created it with an assumption that we'll be creating separate LKMs for each syscall. So, the makefile works such as for example, if open syscall then the folder name should be open and the code should be written in a file inside the same folder named intercept_open.c .
Logs stored in format : 'ISOLATES:<syscall intercepted>,<process name>,<process id>,<user id>c
Logs stored in System Call Logging/dmesglogs.txt
Observation : In original logs logs, saw some user ids other than root(0), nbs(1000) which had id : 104
> getent passwd "104" -- syslog:x:104:108::/home/syslog:/bin/false
Probably for writing kernel logs
I think that's why the logs were filling so fast because the act of writing to logs was also getting captured in the logs.
After selectively logging the system calls, the logs were of decent size.

Week 6 :

Isolation

Week 7 :

MidSems

Logged file operations system calls like open, close, read, write.

Created new user : name : isol, pass : 1
Refer https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-and-delete-users-on-ubuntu-16-04 for adduser command.
Couldn't use this as it doesn't have permissions to create files in Desktop of user nbs
Working with user nbs for now.
Refer https://askubuntu.com/questions/468236/how-can-i-find-my-user-id-uid-from-terminal to find user id.

Trying to print file accessed by simple http server written in go (language chosen because it gives statically compiled binary with everything included in the binary itself).
Printing specific logs based on $UID = 1000.
While trying to print filename passed to open function, the system hangs because of __user macro in the parameter declaration which means that the parameter is in user space.
Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45405442/what-is-the-meaning-of-argument-type-const-char-user-const-user-argv
Refer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4521551/what-are-the-implications-of-the-linux-user-macro
Using copy_from_user function to copy from user space to kernel space. It worked.
Refer https://www.fsl.cs.sunysb.edu/kernel-api/re257.html
cscope -Rd to start cscope without updating the database.
Modes definition found by searching O_RDONLY using cscope. Definitions of all modes given in fcntl.h. Those accessible in kernel mentioned in linux-4.19.102/include/linux/fcntl.h
Currently watching only O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY | O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC | O_APPEND, NDELAY and NONBLOCK has same value as defined in fcntl.h (cscope).
Ran go executable, observed that it accessed files from /lib/...
Then statically compiled and again ran the executable, this time didn't see any mention of the server process in dmesg. May be because it is using execve, to directly execute some other process.
Digression : after compiling used strip command on the binary simplestHTTPServer to remove the symbols and reduce the file size from 5.6 MB to 5.2 MB.
Digression : Command 'sudo lsof | grep simple' used to see open files.

Next, we try to selectively block the syscalls of a process with a particular parent pid by hardcoding this pid.
The definition of task_struct can be found in /usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-45/include/linux/sched.h
In the definition, this was mentioned :
/*
         * Pointers to the (original) parent process, youngest child, younger sibling,
         * older sibling, respectively.  (p->father can be replaced with
         * p->real_parent->pid)
         */

        /* Real parent process: */
        struct task_struct __rcu        *real_parent;

        /* Recipient of SIGCHLD, wait4() reports: */
        struct task_struct __rcu        *parent;

Refer https://medium.com/hungys-blog/linux-kernel-process-99629d91423c , it says
Real parent vs. parent
The field parent in task_struct usually matches the process descriptor pointed by real_parent.
real_parent: Points to the process descriptor of the process that created P or to the descriptor of process 1 (init) if the parent process no longer exists.
parent: Points to the current parent of P (this is the process that must be signaled when the child process terminates, i.e. SIGCHLD). It may occasionally differ from real_parent in some cases, such as when another process issues a ptrace() system call requesting that it be allowed to monitor P.

Tested by blocking open system for all processes that are children of bash by checking parent's (real_parent) pid.
Commands like ls, dmesg were not running. The go server when built directly was not running and we saw that it was opening some library files .so outside its own folder. But, the go server (simplestHTTPServer) was running when built statically probably because it's not opening anything, just uses execve call.

Week 8 :

Next, we want to selectively log following network calls made by the static go server and python server when build from source at a location.
read, write, socket, signal, accept, connect, exit, fork, bind, : socketcall and list : http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketcall.2.html
build python from source and in that location run : ./python -m http.server
The parameters for some of the calls weren't available in syscalls.h so had to look it up, found the declarations in socket.h file, can be searched using __sys_socket, found in linux-4.19.102/include/linux/socket.h
Digression : on cscoping __sys_accept4, found its definition in linux-.../net/socket.c and found that __sys_accept actually makes a call to __sys_accept4 itself by putting parameter for flags as 0.
Digression : Note that declaration of __sys_sendmsg, __sys_sendmmsg and __sys_recvmsg in linux-.../include/linux/socket.h was different from sys_sendmsg, sys_sendmmsg and sys_recvmsg in /usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-45/include/linux/syscalls.h where all syscalls are given, they had an extra bool parameter and following comment :

/* The __sys_...msg variants allow MSG_CMSG_COMPAT iff
 * forbid_cmsg_compat==false
 */
extern long __sys_sendmsg(int fd, struct user_msghdr __user *msg, unsigned int flags, bool forbid_cmsg_compat);
asmlinkage long sys_sendmsg(int fd, struct user_msghdr __user *msg, unsigned flags);

While writing the custom calls I have followed the signatures of the ones mentioned in /usr/src/.../syscalls.h
All the custom calls are defined in the order given in the list.
Do the #ifdef check when doing for every system call
Syscalls list for x86 is given here : http://asm.sourceforge.net/syscall.html

Week 9 :

Blocking all system calls available in file /usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-45/include/linux/syscalls.h

Observation :
There are a few syscalls based on the number of bits in the system. 
There are many syscalls whose availability depends on if certain constants are defined which i think is for backward compatibility. 
Many of the commands that we use have direct syscalls associated with them like rename, stat, etc.
Don't know the use of sysquota32ctl, couldn't find it anywhere else using cscope.
Max 6 params are allowed as visible from the #define MAP6 in the beginning of syscalls file.

Template :

asmlinkage long sys_close(unsigned int fd);

#ifdef __NR_close
static asmlinkage long custom_close(unsigned int fd)
{
    asmlinkage long (*org_close)(unsigned int fd);
    if(current->real_parent->pid == 12970)
    {
    	printk(KERN_WARNING "ISOLATES:close,%s,%d,%d\n", current->comm, current->pid, current->cred->uid.val);
    }
    org_close = (asmlinkage long (*)(unsigned int fd)) org_sys_table[__NR_close];
    return org_close(fd);
}
#endif

Regex used in gedit :

Matching syscalls : ^asmlinkage long sys_(\w+)\((.*)\);$
Replacement       : #ifdef __NR_\1\nstatic asmlinkage long custom_\1(\2)\n{\n    asmlinkage long (*org_\1)(\2);\n    if(current->real_parent->pid == PARENTPID)\n    {\n    	printk(KERN_WARNING "ISOLATES:\1,%s,%d,%d\\\\n", current->comm, current->pid, current->cred->uid.val);\n    }\n    org_\1 = (asmlinkage long (*)(\2)) org_sys_table[__NR_\1];\n}\n#endif\n
Matching the entire line for replication and repetition : (org_\w+ = .*)
Matching 0 param  : ^\s+org_(\w+) = \(asmlinkage long \(\*\)\(void\).*;$
Replacement       : \0\n    return org_\1();
Matching 1 param  : ^\s+org_(\w+) = \(asmlinkage long \(\*\)\([^,\n]* \*?(\w+)\).*;$
Replacement       : \0\n    return org_\1(\2);
The above trick might fail for next replacements when the parameter was already a single fd. Hence, for 2 params the following trick. Solved by removing return line altogether.
Matching 2 params : ^\s+org_(\w+) = \(asmlinkage long \(\*\)\([^,\n]* \*?(\w+),[^,\n]* \*?(\w+)\).*;$
Replacement       : \0\n    return org_\1(\2, \3);

Replacement       : \0\n    return org_\1(\2, \3, \4, \5, \6, \7);
Just for checking, we will try with 7 parameters

Added following to Makefile to remove unused functions warnings :
EXTRA_CFLAGS := -Wno-unused-function
For some functions couldn't find it in kernel code : got sigaction and rt_sigaction from https://linux.die.net/man/2/rt_sigaction, got uname from http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/uname.2.html.
Many such syscalls appearing in error were also present in file linux-.../include/linux/compat.h with prefix compat_, found using text string search like pselect6
Functions like custom_sigaction, custom_send didn't show up in the errors even though the function wasn't written correctly still I wrote them correctly. Still many functions were left like custom_org_readdir. To not confuse org_old, need to change our prefix org_ to org_
Found sys_clone in linux-.../arch/openrisc/include/asm/syscalls.h

Regex used in gedit for init and exit modules:

Matching syscalls : ^asmlinkage long sys_(\w+)\((.*)\);$
Storing original  : #ifdef __NR_\1\n    org_sys_table[__NR_\1] = sys_call_table[__NR_\1];\n#endif
Assigning custom  : #ifdef __NR_\1\n    sys_call_table[__NR_\1] = (sys_call_ptr_t)custom_\1;\n#endif
Assigning org     : #ifdef __NR_\1\n    sys_call_table[__NR_\1] = org_sys_table[__NR_\1];\n#endif

I was thinking that since we already had all the system calls available in linux/syscalls.h, why not directly call it but then we are not sure if they are the ones actually pointed in the system call table but with our method, we are guaranteed.

Its not working : starts behaving mysteriously and hangs if doing something on terminal, and closes abruptly on rmmodding instantly

Binary searching to find the errant syscalls :
Commenting printk first to check if it works
Matching  : printk.*
Replacing : //\0\n\t\t;

Rewriting the code by removing the predefined ifdefs from syscalls.h and using macros in reallops and using binary search to determine which syscalls are creating the problems.
Macros : argument x :
#x results in "x", stringifies x
##x results in x , means the argument supplied to x, helps in reading (x = open) _##x as _open instead of _x as _x, useful for concatenating tokens, if not concatenating tokens then we can directly use x
Multiple words separated by space can be given as arguments example : #define a(x) x - 5 : a(5 + 5) resolves to 5 + 5 - 5
Variable arguments can be given to macros, refer https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variable-length-arguments-for-macros/
gcc -E shows the expanded macros, remove the include files to avoid fatal error when library not found

Observation : The processes created inside a bash have UID of the parent process.

Create an excel sheet syscalltoflag.csv with all the syscalls signatures and the conditions on the flags.

Digression : C doesn't have function overloading. So, even though the function sys_sigsuspend has 2 definitions, only 1 would be active as only one of the MACROS out of CONFIG_OLD_SIGSUSPEND and CONFIG_OLD_SIGSUSPEND3 would be defined.

For newstat, there was 2 definition depending on the conditions. True for newstat, newlstat, newfstat.
#define __NR3264_stat 1038
__SC_3264(__NR3264_stat, sys_stat64, sys_newstat)
#define __NR_stat 1049
__SYSCALL(__NR_stat, sys_newstat)

No .*16 functions like chown16,... was present in unistd.c even though present in syscalls.c probably due to the macro constant CONFIG_HAVE_UID16.

Some syscalls were dependent on __ARCH_WANT_SYSCALL_DEPRECATED. True for bdflush, oldumount, send, recv, sysctl.

For ni_syscall, following was defined in unistd.c. Currently putting it with nfsservctl.
/* fs/nfsctl.c */
#define __NR_nfsservctl 42
__SYSCALL(__NR_nfsservctl, sys_ni_syscall)
#define __NR_fork 1079
#ifdef CONFIG_MMU
__SYSCALL(__NR_fork, sys_fork)
#else
__SYSCALL(__NR_fork, sys_ni_syscall)
#endif /* CONFIG_MMU */

For sync_file_range2 following conditions were defined.
#ifdef __ARCH_WANT_SYNC_FILE_RANGE2
#define __NR_sync_file_range2 84
__SC_COMP(__NR_sync_file_range2, sys_sync_file_range2, \
	  compat_sys_sync_file_range2)
#else
#define __NR_sync_file_range 84
__SC_COMP(__NR_sync_file_range, sys_sync_file_range, \
	  compat_sys_sync_file_range)
#endif

There were links to function sys_mmap but it was not listed in syscalls.c.

Adding extra macros to accomodate custom __NR_... :
#define STOREORIGCONST(x,y) org_sys_table[__NR_##y] = sys_call_table[__NR_##y]
#define APPLYCUSTCONST(x,y) sys_call_table[__NR_##y] = (sys_call_ptr_t)custom_##x
#define APPLYORIGCONST(x,y) sys_call_table[__NR_##y] = org_sys_table[__NR_##y]
Following is for CUSTFUNC0CONST(ni_syscall, nfsservctl)
#define CUSTFUNC0CONST(x,y) \
static asmlinkage long custom_##x(void)\
{\
    asmlinkage long (*org_##x)(void);\
    if(current->real_parent->pid == PARENTPID)\
    {\
    	printk(KERN_WARNING "ISOLATES:"#x",%s,%d,%d\n", current->comm, current->pid, current->cred->uid.val);\
    }\
    org_##x = (asmlinkage long (*)(void)) org_sys_table[__NR_##y];\
    return org_##x();\
}
Following is for CUSTFUNC1CONST(newuname, struct new_utsname __user *, name, uname)
#define CUSTFUNC1CONST(x,t1,p1,y) \
static asmlinkage long custom_##x(t1 p1)\
{\
    asmlinkage long (*org_##x)(t1);\
    if(current->real_parent->pid == PARENTPID)\
    {\
    	printk(KERN_WARNING "ISOLATES:"#x",%s,%d,%d\n", current->comm, current->pid, current->cred->uid.val);\
    }\
    org_##x = (asmlinkage long (*)(t1)) org_sys_table[__NR_##y];\
    return org_##x(p1);\
}
Following is for CUSTFUNC2CONST(umount, char __user *, name,  int , flags, umount2)
#define CUSTFUNC2CONST(x,t1,p1,t2,p2,y) \
static asmlinkage long custom_##x(t1 p1, t2 p2)\
{\
    asmlinkage long (*org_##x)(t1, t2);\
    if(current->real_parent->pid == PARENTPID)\
    {\
    	printk(KERN_WARNING "ISOLATES:"#x",%s,%d,%d\n", current->comm, current->pid, current->cred->uid.val);\
    }\
    org_##x = (asmlinkage long (*)(t1, t2)) org_sys_table[__NR_##y];\
    return org_##x(p1, p2);\
}

Still after correcting the above issues, the problem of system getting hanged after rmmod remains. Applying binary search to identify the syscalls creating this problem :
nanosleep is creating problem. After rmmodding it shows error like Bad RIP value copied into dmesglogs. Also, the capability of copying text between mac and parallels is gone.
